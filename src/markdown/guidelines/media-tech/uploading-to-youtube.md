## Where to upload from?
We recommend using **YouTube Studio** for uploading videos. For more efficient workflows, we recommend doing this from your laptop or PC.

- [YouTube Studio (Web)](https://studio.youtube.com)
- [YouTube Studio (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.creator&hl=en)
- [YouTube Studio (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-studio/id888530356)

## Content Format
### Livestreams and Full Song Clips
They must be uploaded in the standard video format.

### Sermon Clips and Short Song Clips
They must be uploaded in the shorts or reels format.

## Video Titles
Video titles briefly define the content in a video. _**The formats listed below should be followed as-is**_, including spacing, correct punctuations and separators, etc.

### Livestreams
#### Service Type
Each service has a specific service type. The only valid service types are: `Sunday Service`, `Bible Study`, `Covenant Meal with Christ`, `Healing Crusade`.

For special service types, please refer to [this section](#deviations-special-cases-and-general-inquiries) of the article.

#### Outreach Name
Outreach names are the names of the outreach the service took place in. Examples include: `Mother Church`, `Mt. Moriah`.

#### Outreach Town
Outreach towns are the towns the service took place in. Examples include: `Angono`, `Morong`, `San Antonio`, `Baguio`.

#### Outreach State
Outreach states are the states the service took place in. Examples include: `Rizal`, `Nueva Ecija`, `Benguet`.

#### Composition
```
<service_type> @ <outreach_name> (<outreach_town>, <outreach_state>) DD/MM/YY
```

### Praise and Worship Clips
#### Song title
Titles must be in [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case). We are using the [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case) for song titles.

```
"I will bless the Lord at all times." - ❌ Incorrect capitalization
"I Will Bless The Lord At All Times" - ❌ Incorrect capitalization

"I Will Bless the Lord At All Times" - ✅ Follows the APA style
```

Each song title **MUST** follow their original release title as listed on streaming platforms like Spotify, or YouTube Music. One must verify the authenticity of the song title before going with it.

You **MUST NEVER** guess what the title is from the lyrics alone. It **MUST** be looked up on said streaming platforms or other reputable sources.

```
"Jesus, O Glorious / Glory, Glory to the Lamb" - ❌ Incorrect titles from the original release titles

"Oh the Glory of His Presence / For You Are Glorious" - ✅ Follows the original release titles
```

If you're unsure about the song itle, please refer to [this section](#deviations-special-cases-and-general-inquiries) of the article.

If the song is a medley of songs, the song title should include all the titles of the songs in the medley. Each song should be separated by a forward slash `/` with spaces in between the slashes.

```
"My Redeemer Lives•How Great Thou Art•Because He Lives" - ❌ Incorrect separator, incorrect spacing
"My Redeemer Lives - How Great Thou Art - Because He Lives" - ❌ Incorrect separator, correct spacing
"My Redeemer Lives/How Great Thou Art/Because He Lives" - ❌ Correct separator, wrong spacing

"My Redeemer Lives / How Great Thou Art / Because He Lives" - ✅ Follows the correct specifications
```

YouTube titles are always limited to 100 characters. If the medley title is longer than 100 characters, the anchoring song of the medley will be the title of the video. Or in some cases, the theme will be considered the title of the medley.

```
"My Redeemer Lives Medley" - ✅ Uses the anchoring song
"The Revival Medley" - ✅ Uses the main theme of the medley
```

#### Artist name/s
The artist name/s are the names of the worshippers who led the song in the video. If there are multiple names, each name is separated with a comma `,`.

```
matthew hernandez - ❌ Incorrect capitalization
Matthew Hernandez & Jeremiah Amador - ❌ Incorrect separator

Matthew Hernandez - ✅ Correct capitalization
Matthew Hernandez, Jeremiah Amador - ✅ Correct capitalization and separator
```

#### Composition
Please **DO NOT** forget the `(LIVE)` indicator in the title. As most of the clips are taken from the livestreams, it's important to indicate that this version of the song is from a live source.
```
<song_title> (LIVE) | <artist_name>
```

### Sermon Clips and Short Song Clips
Titles for sermon clips and short song clips are _always_ a special case. Please [consult the authors](#deviations-special-cases-and-general-inquiries) for this.

## Video Descriptions
Each video will always have this common description attached to them:

### Praise and Worship Medleys
Every praise and worship medley should have a list of all song titles in the description followed by a `---` to separate the common description. Even here, it should follow the proper title casing (APA style).

```
